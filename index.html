                        <h3>Pick the right destination</h3>
                        <p>One of the most important things as a solo female traveller is to choose your destination
                            wisely.
                            If this
                            is your first time travelling alone, it’s ok to feel nervous about your adventure! The best
                            thing to calm your nerves is to be comfortable with the destination you’re going to.

                            It might not be the smartest thing to go on a solo exploring Amazon rainforest for your
                            first
                            solo trip..
                            Unless you’re sure about what you’re doing, stick with destinations that have proven safe
                            for
                            women travelling alone.

                            Destinations like Bali, Europe and Australia are excellent for solo travellers. </p>

                        <h3>
                            Have at least your first two nights booked
                        </h3>
                        <p>Nothing is better than having a place to stay when arriving and immediately getting a shower
                            and
                            not wasting time on searching a place to stay.</p>

                        <h3>Do your research</h3>
                        <p>Make sure to google some things about the place you're going: cultural specifics, scams and
                            danger etc.

                        <h3>Have an access to an unlimited internet</h3>
                        <p>It's nice to have peace of mind knowing you can always use your phone to make a call or use
                            the
                            GPS if you need to.</p>

                        <h3>Documents and money</h3>
                        <p>Always keep your money (cash/credit card) in safe places from pickpocketing and have digital
                            copies of your documents in case they're stolen</p>

                        <h3>Pack light</h3>
                        <p>Surely, you don't want to be lugging around heavy bags when you have to get somewhere,
                            especially
                            when you don't have anyone to help you. Stick with the travel essentials and items that you
                            really need.</p>

                        <h3>Listen to your guts!</h3>
                        <p>When you feel like something doesn't feel right, you are most likely correct. So, follow your
                            gut! If you don't feel safe in a situation, get out of there right away.</p>
