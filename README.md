  * ### Design
    * Building this website I was using 

 * ### Testing
   * This webpage works in different browsers: Chrome, Safari, Opera.
   * I made sure that the page is responsive and functions properly on all standart screen sizes by using devtools device toolbar
   * I made sure that navigation, links, lifehacks are all readable and easy to understand
   * The form works: every field requires to be filled, email address requires only email address, dates field requires only dates, submit button works properly.
* ### Bugs and Unfixed Bugs
   * In "community-trips" section there are links on each image that are supposed to give detailed info about the trip. These links take user to wiitravel pages because pages that they're referred to do not exist yet.
   * when testing I found that my links don't have discernible name, so it was fixed by adding "aria-label" to <a> elements.
   * No other bugs are found.
