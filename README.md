### Creative process

   * The idea of the website seems relevant strategy-wise. The information on site can be valuable for user as well as for business. 
   * The site is simple, consists of one page, text, images, navigation menu, form and links, has all the information that attracts the user and it has potential of developing bit by bit.
   * The next step of creating site was building a mockup by using [Balsamiq wireframes]("https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/")

### Design
   * While building this website I was using Lato and Oswald fonts, there is a theme of three main colors on the page, which are appealing to user's eye, have a sufficient contrast ratio. 
 * The webpage has eye-pleasing images, that motivate user to make this decision: to go and explore the World.
* The elements has 3d styling effect, which represents traveler - constantly "floating" (moving).

 * ### Testing
   * This webpage works in different browsers: Chrome, Safari, Opera.
   * I made sure that the page is responsive and functions properly on all standart screen sizes by using devtools device toolbar.
   * I made sure that navigation, links, lifehacks are all readable and easy to understand.
   * The form works: every field requires to be filled, email address requires only email address, dates field requires only dates, submit button works properly.
* ### Bugs and Unfixed Bugs
   * In "community-trips" section there are links on each image that are supposed to give detailed info about the trip. These links take user to [Wikitravel]("https://wikitravel.org/") pages because pages that they're referred to do not exist yet.
   * when testing I found that my links don't have discernible name, so it was fixed by adding "aria-label" to elements.
   * No other bugs are found.
